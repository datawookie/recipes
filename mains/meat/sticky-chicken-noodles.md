# Sticky Chicken Noodles

## Ingredients

For the chicken:

- 500 g chicken thighs
- 1 cup flour
- 1 cup cornflour
- 1 t salt
- 2 eggs
- 1 T soy sauce
- oil

For sauce:

- 1/3 cup soy sauce
- 1 T rice vinegar
- 3 garlic cloves crushed
- 2 T honey
- pinch of chilli flakes
- 2 t cornflour 

To serve:

- Noodles
- spring onion chopped
- coriander

## Method

1. Cut chicken into bite-size chunks.
2. Whisk the flour, cornstarch and salt together in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs and soy sauce together. ðŸš¨ Don't omit either the salt or the soy sauce.
3. Coat the chicken first in the flour then in the egg and again in the flour, pressing the flour onto the chicken to make sure it's well covered.
4. Heat oil in a deep pot or wok.
5. Carefully add the chicken and allow to fry until the chicken is golden brown, crisp and cooked through, approximately 4-5 minutes. ðŸš¨ Don't overcrowd the chicken or it will not crisp nicely. Just be patient and do more smaller batches.
6. Remove with a slotted spoon and allow to drain. 
7. While the chicken fries, make the sauce. Combine the soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, cornstarch, chilli flakes and garlic and whisk together. Pour into a saucepan and bring to a simmer.
8. Cook for a few minutes until the sauce has thickened. The sauce should have a syrupy consistency but not be too thick. 
9. Toss the chicken and cooked, drained noodles with the sauce. Scatter over spring onions and coriander.
