# Mom' Chicken Casserole

## Ingredients

- 1 or 2 onions
- garlic
- mushrooms
- chicken
- bacon
- chicken stock
- wine
- orzo (optional)

## Method

1. Fry chopped onions and add mushrooms, bacon, and garlic.
2. Remove from the pan and then brown the chicken pieces.
3. Add them to the onion mixture in the casserole.
4. Pour some boiling water into the pan and crumble a chicken stock cube into it.
5. This, together with a glass of wine, must be added to the casserole along with seasoning and vegetables as desired.
6. Cover and bake at 180Â°C or put into a slow cooker.
7. Optionally add the orzo along with a cup of water (or more?) for the last hour in the slow cooker. If you don't add the water then the whole thing dries out too much.
