# Roast Pork

## Method

Consider soaking the pork in brine before cooking. This can really enhance the roast.

1. If there is rind on the meat, deeply score it with a knife. Then leave the meat uncovered in the fridge for a while, which will help to dry out the rind.
2. Rub olive oil and salt into the find.
3. Roast for 20-30 minutes at 220 °C.
4. Roast for 40-45 minutes per kg of meat at 180 °C.
