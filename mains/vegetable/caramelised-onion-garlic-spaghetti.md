# Caramelised Onion & Garlic Spaghetti

## Ingredients

- 1 large onion, thinly sliced
- 4 cloves of garlic, minced, plus more for garlic chili crisp
- 2 tablespoons of garlic chili crisp, plus more for serving (we use @ramanokramâ€™s garlic chilli oil - so good)
- Salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 cup of coconut milk or cream
- 1 teaspoon of dry parsley
- 8 ounces of pasta (your choice of shape)
- sugar
- Olive oil

## Method

1. Start by preparing all your ingredients. Thinly slice the onion, mince the garlic, and measure out your garlic chili crisp, coconut milk or cream, and dry parsley. Set aside.
2. In a large skillet over medium heat, add a couple of tablespoons of olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the sliced onions with a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 10-15 minutes or until the onions are golden brown and caramelized. If the onions start to stick, you can add a little water to the pan to help deglaze it.
3. While the onions are caramelizing, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside, reserving some of the pasta water for later.
4. Once the onions are caramelized, add the minced garlic to the skillet. Cook for about 1 minute or until fragrant. Then, stir in the garlic chili crisp, and cook for another minute. Pour in the coconut milk or cream, add the dry parsley, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Let the sauce simmer for a few minutes to thicken slightly.
5. Add the cooked pasta to the skillet with the sauce, tossing to combine. If the sauce is too thick, add a bit of the reserved pasta water until you reach your desired consistency.
6. Serve the pasta hot, topped with an extra spoonful of garlic chili crisp for those who enjoy a bit more heat. You can also sprinkle some parsley on top for a hint of color. Enjoy!
