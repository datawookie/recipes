# Banana Cake

<!-- https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/best-banana-cake/ -->

## Ingredients

- 345g mashed bananas (about 4 medium or 3 large bananas)
- 375g all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)
- 1 t baking powder
- 1 t baking soda
- 1/2 t ground cinnamon
- 1/2 t salt
- 170g unsalted butter, softened to room temperature
- 200g granulated sugar
- 100g packed light or dark brown sugar
- 3 large eggs, at room temperature
- 2 t vanilla extract
- 360 ml buttermilk, at room temperature

## Method

1. Preheat the oven to 180 °C and grease a 9×13 inch pan.
2. Mash the bananas.
3. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together.
4. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter on high
speed until smooth and creamy—about 1 minute. Add both sugars and beat on high speed
for 2 minutes until creamed together. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl
with a rubber spatula as needed. Add the eggs and the vanilla. Beat on medium-high speed
until combined, then beat in the mashed bananas. Scrape down the sides and up the
bottom of the bowl as needed. With the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients in three
additions alternating with the buttermilk and mixing each addition just until incorporated. Do
not overmix. The batter will be slightly thick and a few lumps is OK.
5. Spread batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 45–50 minutes. Baking times vary, so keep an
eye on yours. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. If
you find the top of the cake is browning too quickly in the oven, loosely cover it with
aluminum foil.
6. Remove the cake from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to cool completely. After
about 45 minutes, I usually place it in the refrigerator to speed things up.
