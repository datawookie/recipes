# Kombucha

## Ingredients

- 10 green tea bags
- 1 kg white sugar

## Method

1. Get a BIG saucepan and add 10 green teabags.
2. Fill it up with boiling water and brew for 10-15 minutes on a hob.
3. Take the teabags out, and while the water's still hot, stir in sugar, until it's completely dissolved.
4. Add a few litres of cold water to a brew bucket, and a litre or so to the tea if there's room. Or just pour it in to the cold water in the brew bin. Just don't get the brew bin plastic too hot.
5. Top up to 10 litres. You might need to add a kettle or two full of hot water as you top up, as the sugary tea needs to be at about body temperature before you add the big snotty thing.
6. Add the big snotty thing. Just let it Sip into the tea with all its juice.
7. Don't seal the brew bin. I stretch an old clean t-shirt or a tea towel over the top and then sit the lid on top. This lets it breathe but stops fruit flies or general dust, fluff, etc. getting in.
8. Put it in a safe corner where it won't get too disturbed, and where it's fairly warm rnost of the time. It shouldn't get too cold but don't worry too much, it'll just take a bit longer to do its thing.
9. Leave it a week, then check it still looks bloody horrible: that's a good sign.
10. After a couple more days, start checking it with a hydrometer to make sure the sugar's doing its thing properly. When it's above the red line, or at 'medium' for wine — preferably by half a cm or more, syphon the whole lot off carefully into your swing-top bottles. Leave a couple of crn of air in the neck of the bottle so the brew can continue to develop (second-stage ferment).
11. Put the scoby in a tightly sealed glass jar, topping up with the dregs in the brew bin — this helps keep it healthy — and refrigerate (but don't' freeze).
12. You can add flavouring as you bottle up if you like, such as a dribble of boiled up raspberries or blueberries, or elderflower or ginger cordial. Leave for a couple of weeks until the tops are obviously releasing air when you pop them. Worth checking a random few every few days after a week or so.
13. When they're popping nicely and the sugar's mostly become fizz, stick a few in the fridge.
14. Pop, quaff and burp. Say AAAAAAGGHHH. 

While its a fairly delicate process, the scoby is pretty hardy. It looks horrible but that's usually a good thing. It can stay in its sealed jar for as long as you like: it'll just lie dormant until you put it to work again.
