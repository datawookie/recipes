# Fig Jam

## Ingredients

- 1 lemon
- 3/4 cup white sugar
- 2 T honey
- 1.5 T lemon juice
- 0.5 kg figs

## Method

1. Using a peeler, shave strips of rind from lemon (just the skin, not the pith).
2. Put rind strips and other ingredients in a pot. Stir.
3. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently.
4. Reduce heat and allow to simmer slowly for 40-50 minutes, stirring frequently.
5. Pour into sterilised jar.

I doubled the quantity of figs and sugar, leaving remaining ingredients the same.
