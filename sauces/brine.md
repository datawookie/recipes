# Brine

Brines and marinades serve a similar purpose: they both make meat taste better. While a marinade adds flavour, a brine gives moisture.

A brine would usually be used with lean meat, which due to the lack of fact, can dry out when cooked. Brines work well with pork, chicken and turkey.

## Ingredients

- 1 salt
- 2 sugar
- 16 water

These proportions are by _volume_.

_Optional:_

- garlic
- rosemary
- ginger

_Variation:_

For a beer brine, replase half of the water with beer.

## Method

1. Dissolve the salt and sugar in the water.
2. If adding optional ingredients, mash them with a pestle and mortar, then add to the brine.
3. Submerge the meat in the brine for a period of between 30 minutes and 24 hours. The more meat, the longer time is required.

To test whether the brining has been successful, the meat should be heavier afterwards than before due to the additional retained moisture.
